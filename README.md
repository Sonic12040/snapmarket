# CarrotSnap

This web application is meant to connect users to farmer’s markets in their area that accept food assistance benefits such as WIC and SNAP. People who get these types of assistance benefits often get incentives for purchasing fresh food from markets like these. Our target user would not only be someone who qualifies for these benefits, but also social workers, educators, refugee resettlement office workers and anyone who takes an interest in viewing this data. We used nation-wide data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

### Navigating the app

The web page loads ready for a user to select which preferences they have for their search of markets, including five payment methods and a zip code. After they submit their search, a map below populates accordingly, or lets the user know if there aren’t any markets in the area. If there are multiple markets in the area, a user can interact with the orange, custom carrot map markers to find out more information about a specific market. The map modal includes a market’s name, addresses, accepted benefits and a list of available items the market sells.

### Technology List

Made with React.js and Redux. We used the google-map-react npm package.
